# Outfit Recommendation Algorithm

This document outlines the rules, algorithms, and guidelines for generating outfit recommendations based on color theory, fashion principles, occasion requirements, seasonal considerations, and style compatibility.

## 1. Color Theory for Outfit Matching

### 1.1 The Color Wheel Basics

Colors are divided into two groups:
- **Warm colors**: Reds, oranges, yellows
- **Cool colors**: Blues, greens, purples

**Neutral colors** (don't appear on the color wheel but essential in fashion):
- Black, white, gray, beige, brown
- Navy and olive are also considered neutrals in clothing as they pair easily with almost any color

### 1.2 Color Matching Schemes

#### Complementary Colors
- Colors opposite each other on the color wheel
- Examples: Blue ↔ Orange, Red ↔ Green, Yellow ↔ Purple
- Create balanced, vibrant contrast
- **Rule**: Use sparingly - best as one clothing piece + one accessory to avoid overwhelming the outfit
- High contrast looks work better with neutral tonal differences (cream vs. dark brown, white vs. navy)

#### Analogous Colors
- Colors sitting next to each other on the wheel
- Examples: Green ↔ Blue, Red ↔ Orange, Yellow ↔ Green
- Share similar hues, create harmonious and pleasing effects
- Easier to execute than complementary schemes
- Natural, cohesive look

#### Monochromatic Colors
- Different shades, tones, and tints of the same color family
- Example: Light blue → Royal blue → Navy blue
- Creates sophisticated, polished, balanced, and calm appearance
- Low risk, always elegant

#### Triadic Colors
- Three colors equally spaced on the color wheel
- Examples: Red-Yellow-Blue, Orange-Green-Purple
- Vibrant and balanced when used correctly

### 1.3 The 3-Color Rule

A foundational styling guideline:
- **Dominant color**: Makes up the majority of the outfit (60%)
- **Secondary color**: Takes up roughly a third (30%)
- **Accent color**: Small pops of color (10%)

**Exceptions**:
- Black and white don't count as colors - they can be added to any 3-color outfit
- Metallics (gold, silver) work as neutral additions
- Skin tone can act as a "color" when exposed
- Hair and makeup can count as the "third color"

### 1.4 Color Proportions (Golden Ratio)

Apply the 1:2 ratio for visual harmony:
- Primary color: ~60% of outfit
- Secondary color: ~30% of outfit
- Accent color: ~10% of outfit

## 2. Fashion Rules for Pairing Items

### 2.1 The 3-3-3 Rule (Capsule Wardrobe)

- Select 3 tops, 3 bottoms, and 3 pairs of shoes that all work together
- Creates 27 possible outfit combinations
- Ensures maximum versatility

### 2.2 The 2 Out of 3 Rule

When creating an outfit, match 2 out of 3 elements:
- Top + Bottom = Same color (creates "column of color")
- Top + Shoes = Same color
- Bottom + Shoes = Same color

### 2.3 Item Pairing Guidelines

#### Tops + Bottoms
- **Balance proportions**: Fitted top with looser bottom, or vice versa
- **Avoid competing patterns**: If top has bold print, keep bottom solid
- **Texture mixing**: Combine different textures for depth (cotton + leather, silk + denim)
- **High-waisted bottoms**: Pair with cropped or tucked tops

#### Bottoms + Shoes
- **Pants length determines shoe style**:
  - Full-length pants: Oxfords, loafers, boots, sneakers
  - Cropped pants: Ankle boots, loafers, statement shoes
  - Shorts: Sneakers, sandals, boat shoes
- **Color coordination**: Shoes can match pants for leg-lengthening effect
- **Formality matching**: Dress pants need dress shoes; casual pants need casual shoes

#### Tops + Shoes
- Can create bookend effect when matching
- Casual tops → Casual shoes
- Dressy tops → Dressy shoes

### 2.4 Layering Rules

- **Third piece rule**: Outfit = top + bottom + third layer (jacket, cardigan, vest)
- Add dimension without bulk
- Layer textures, not just colors
- Ensure each layer is wearable on its own

### 2.5 Print and Pattern Rules

- **One statement piece**: If wearing a bold print, keep other items solid
- **Scale mixing**: Large print + small print can work together
- **Color extraction**: Pull colors from a printed piece for other items
- **Stripe rule**: Horizontal stripes add width, vertical add height
