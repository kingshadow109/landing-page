## Tone of Voice

### Brand Personality

**Innovative but Approachable**
We're cutting-edge but never intimidating. We explain complex technology in simple terms.

**Energetic but Not Hype-y**
We're enthusiastic about health and fitness, but we avoid overpromising or using gimmicky language.

**Empowering but Not Preachy**
We encourage and support without being judgmental. Every journey is valid.

**Personal but Professional**
We speak like a knowledgeable friend, not a corporate entity.

### Voice Characteristics

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use "you" and "your" | Use third-person corporate speak |
| Be specific about benefits | Make vague claims |
| Show enthusiasm authentically | Use excessive exclamation points |

### Writing Style

**Sentence Structure:**

- When technical terms are necessary, explain them simply
- Avoid buzzwords: "synergy," "leverage," "holistic" (unless genuinely applicable)

|---------------|----------|
| "Our solution leverages advanced algorithms" | "Our smart tracking learns your patterns" |
| "Optimize your wellness journey" | "Reach your goals faster" |
| "Seamlessly integrated ecosystem" | "Everything works together" |
