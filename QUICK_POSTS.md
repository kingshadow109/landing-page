Hey r/SideProject!

I've been working on WearX - an AI-powered fashion app that helps you:

📸 **Digitize your wardrobe** - Upload photos, AI categorizes everything
🤖 **Get outfit recommendations** - Based on your actual clothes
🌤️ **Weather-aware styling** - No more sweating in sweaters
💰 **Track cost-per-wear** - See which pieces are worth it
🧬 **Discover your style DNA** - Personalized style profile

**The problem:** I was staring at a closet full of clothes with "nothing to wear"

**The solution:** AI that knows what you own and suggests outfits you'll actually wear

**Tech stack:** Next.js 14, Gemini AI, Tailwind

Looking for beta testers who want to stop wardrobe decision fatigue!

**Title:** Tool: I made an app that suggests outfits from clothes you already own

**Body:**
Hey MFA!

Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I built something I think this community might appreciate.

**WearX** helps you:
- Upload your wardrobe (photos)
- Get AI-powered outfit suggestions
- See cost-per-wear for each piece
- Build a more intentional closet

**Why:** I was buying new clothes every season but wearing the same 5 outfits. This helped me realize I had 30+ combinations I never tried.

**For the data nerds:** Tracks wears, cost-per-wear, style categories

Looking for guys who want to test it and help me improve it.

Would love feedback from this community specifically!
