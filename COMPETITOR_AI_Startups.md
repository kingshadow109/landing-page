## Market Gaps & Opportunities

### 1. **Mid-Market Accessibility Gap**
- **Gap**: Enterprise solutions (Vue.ai, Syte) require $3M+ revenue and complex implementation
- **Opportunity**: Affordable, plug-and-play visual AI for DTC and mid-market brands ($500K-$3M revenue)

### 2. **Consumer-Facing Styling Gap**
- **Gap**: Most solutions are B2B/backend focused; The Yes (consumer app) was sunsetted
- **Opportunity**: Direct-to-consumer AI styling app that works across retailers

### 3. **Cross-Retailer Personalization**
- **Gap**: Solutions are siloed to individual retailers
- **Opportunity**: Universal wardrobe/styling assistant that works across all brands

### 4. **Sustainability Integration**
- **Gap**: Limited focus on sustainable/second-hand fashion in visual AI
- **Opportunity**: Visual search that includes thrift, vintage, and sustainable options

### 5. **Social Commerce Integration**
- **Gap**: Visual search exists but isn't deeply integrated with social platforms
- **Opportunity**: "Shop the Look" from Instagram/TikTok/Pinterest with one click

### 6. **Fit & Sizing Intelligence**
- **Gap**: Visual search finds similar items but doesn't solve fit problems
- **Opportunity**: AI that understands body types and recommends size/fit across brands

### 7. **Outfit Building & Styling**
- **Gap**: Most solutions focus on single-item search, not complete outfit creation
- **Opportunity**: AI stylist that builds complete looks from user's existing wardrobe + new items
