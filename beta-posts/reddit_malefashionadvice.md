**Title:** [Beta Testers Wanted] AI stylist app for men — need 10 guys to test it out

**Post:**

What's up MFA!

I've been lurking here for years learning about fit, color coordination, and building a versatile wardrobe. Now I'm building something I wish existed:

**WearX** — an AI-powered wardrobe assistant designed specifically with men's fashion in mind.

**What it does:**
- Upload your clothes (suits, casual wear, shoes, accessories)
- Get outfit recommendations for any occasion (work, dates, weekends)
- Weather-aware suggestions (no more shorts in the rain)
- Style evolution tracking — see how your taste changes over time

**Built with MFA principles:**
- Fit-first recommendations
- Versatility scoring (how many outfits can you make?)
- Color palette suggestions
- Occasion-appropriate styling

**Looking for 10 beta testers:**

**You get:**
- Early access + lifetime premium (free)
- Direct line to give input on features
- Founding member status
- Help shape a tool built for guys who care about their look

**I need:**
- 30-60 min/week testing
- Honest feedback (especially on the recommendation engine)
- iOS or Android device

**Sign up:** [YOUR_SIGNUP_URL]

Spots are limited — looking for guys with different styles (streetwear, business casual, minimalist, etc.).
