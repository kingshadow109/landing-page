## Thread Option 1: The Story Thread

**Tweet 1/5:**
I've been working on something for the past 6 months.

It's called WearX — an AI-powered wardrobe assistant.

And I'm looking for 10 beta testers to help me make it great.

Here's what it does 🧵

**Tweet 2/5:**
The problem: Most people wear 20% of their wardrobe 80% of the time.

We forget what we own.
We buy duplicates.
We stare at our closets feeling like we have nothing to wear.

WearX solves this:

📸 Upload photos of your clothes → AI catalogs them
🤖 Get outfit recommendations based on weather, occasion & style
🔄 Discover new combinations from what you already own

**Behind the scenes:**
Working on the AI recommendation engine for WearX today.

The challenge: Teaching AI to understand not just "blue shirt" but "this blue shirt with these pants for this occasion."

Fashion is surprisingly complex 🤖👗
