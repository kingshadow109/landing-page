**Title:** Built an AI fashion app — looking for 10 beta testers to tear it apart

**Post:**

Hey fellow builders! 👋

I've been working on a side project for the past 6 months and finally have an MVP ready for real users.

**WearX** — AI-powered wardrobe management and outfit recommendations.

**What it does:**
- Users photograph their clothes → AI catalogs them
- Get daily outfit suggestions based on weather, occasion, and personal style
- Discover new combinations from existing wardrobe
- Track style evolution over time

**Tech stack:**
- React Native (mobile app)
- Python/FastAPI (backend)
- OpenAI Vision API (clothing recognition)
- PostgreSQL (wardrobe data)

**Current status:**
- ✅ Core functionality working
- ✅ AI recommendations decent
- 🔄 Onboarding needs polish
- 🔄 Need real user feedback on UX

**Looking for 10 beta testers:**

**Ideal testers:**
- People interested in fashion/tech
- Willing to give brutally honest feedback
- Can commit 30-60 min/week
- iOS or Android

**What you get:**
- Free lifetime premium access
- Direct input on product direction
- Founding member badge
- My eternal gratitude 🙏
