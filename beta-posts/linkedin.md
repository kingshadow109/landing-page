## Post Option 1: Founder Story

**Post:**

6 months ago, I had a problem: I owned dozens of clothes but wore the same 5 outfits.

Sound familiar?

So I started building **WearX** — an AI-powered wardrobe assistant that helps you:

📸 Digitize your closet
🤖 Get personalized outfit recommendations
🌤️ Dress appropriately for weather & occasion
💡 Discover new combinations from clothes you already own

Today, I'm looking for 10 beta testers to help shape this product.

**What's in it for you:**
✅ Early access to AI fashion tech
✅ Free lifetime premium features
✅ Direct input on product roadmap
✅ Founding member recognition

**What I need:**
30-60 minutes per week testing + honest feedback

If you're interested in fashion tech, AI, or just want to solve the "nothing to wear" problem, I'd love your input.

Limited to 10 people for this first round.
