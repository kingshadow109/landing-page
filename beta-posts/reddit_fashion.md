**Title:** Looking for 10 fashion enthusiasts to beta test an AI wardrobe app 🧥✨

**Post:**

Hey r/fashion!

I'm building **WearX** — an AI-powered fashion app that helps you:
- 📸 Digitize your entire wardrobe (just snap photos)
- 🤖 Get personalized outfit recommendations based on your style, weather, and occasion
- 🔄 Mix and match pieces you already own
- 🛍️ Discover new items that actually fit your aesthetic

**Why I'm posting here:**
I need 10 beta testers who genuinely care about fashion to help me shape this product. I'm not looking for casual users — I want people who obsess over their style and can give real feedback.

**What's in it for you:**
- 🚀 Early access (be the first to try it)
- 💎 Free lifetime premium features
- 🏆 "Founding Member" badge in-app
- 🎯 Direct input on product features
- 👕 Optional: WearX merch when we launch

**What I need from you:**
- 30-60 minutes per week testing the app
- Honest feedback (the good, bad, and ugly)
- Willingness to report bugs and suggest improvements

Only 10 spots — first come, first served with a quick screening.
