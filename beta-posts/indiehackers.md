**Title:** Looking for beta testers: AI wardrobe app I've been building for 6 months

**Post:**

Hey IH! 👋

I've been heads-down building something I'm excited to share with this community.

**What I'm building:**
**WearX** — an AI-powered wardrobe assistant that helps people:
- Digitize their closet (snap photos, AI does the rest)
- Get daily outfit recommendations
- Discover new combinations from existing clothes
- Track their style evolution

**The problem:**
Most people wear 20% of their wardrobe 80% of the time. They forget what they own, struggle to put outfits together, and buy duplicates. I wanted to solve this with AI.

**Current status:**
- MVP is functional
- AI recognition working well
- Need real users to validate and refine

**Why I'm posting here:**
This community understands the indie builder journey. I'm not a big startup — I'm one person building something useful. I need feedback from people who appreciate the grind.

**Looking for 10 beta testers:**

**Ideal profile:**
- Interested in fashion/style OR AI/tech
- Willing to give honest, constructive feedback
- Can dedicate 30-60 min/week
- iOS or Android user

**What you get:**
- 🎁 Lifetime premium access (free forever)
- 🏆 Founding member status in-app
- 📢 Direct line to influence features
- 🤝 Join a community of early supporters

**What I need:**
- Test the core features
- Report bugs (there will be some!)
- Share what works and what doesn't
- Suggest improvements

Only taking 10 people for this first round — want to give everyone proper attention.

Would love to hear your thoughts or questions below!
