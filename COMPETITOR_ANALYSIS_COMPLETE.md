## Competitor Deep Dives

### 1. Stitch Fix - The Dying Giant
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue | $1.27B (FY2025) |
| Users | 2.31M (declining -7.9% YoY) |
| Model | $20 styling fee + subscription |
| AI | 75% AI + human stylists |

**Strengths:**
- Massive data moat (4.5B data points)
- AI + human hybrid works
- Strong brand recognition

**Weaknesses (Our Opportunities):**
- ❌ $20 upfront fee = friction
- ❌ 3-day return window pressure
- ❌ Perceived as expensive
- ❌ Style repetition complaints

**WearX Counter:** Instant digital styling, no commitment, transparent pricing, global from day one.

### 2. Amazon StyleSnap - The Convenience King
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| SKUs | 30M+ |
| Visual Search | Yes (CNNs, 3D models) |
| Cost | Free ( Prime ecosystem) |

**Strengths:**
- Massive scale and logistics
- One-click purchasing
- 70% YoY growth in visual searches

**Weaknesses (Our Opportunities):**
- ❌ No sustainability filtering

### 3. AI Fashion Startups - The Enterprise Play
| Company | Focus | Pricing |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Vue.ai | Enterprise orchestration | Custom ($$$$) |
| Syte.ai | Visual AI for apparel | $3M+ revenue minimum |
| Lykdat | Visual search | $49.99/mo |
| Donde Search | Visual discovery | Acquired by Shopify |
| The Yes | Consumer AI shopping | **SHUT DOWN** (Pinterest) |

**Key Insight:** The Yes validated consumer demand but got acquired/shut down. **No one is serving consumers directly with good AI styling.**

**WearX Opportunity:** Mid-market ($1M-$10M brands), consumer-first, easy implementation (days not months).

### 4. Wardrobe Apps - The Disappointment
| App | Pricing | Key Flaw |
|-----|---------|----------|
| Closet+ | $2.99 one-time | iOS only, outdated |
| Stylebook | $4.99 one-time | iOS only, 15 years old |
| Cladwell | Free (was subscription) | AI suggests sweaters in summer |
| Pureple | $14.99/mo or ads | "Forces you to buy" |
| Smart Closet | $4.99 one-time | Data loss issues |

**Universal Problems:**
- ❌ AI is basically random shuffle
- ❌ No weather/context awareness
- ❌ Data loss (dealbreaker)
- ❌ Aggressive ads or subscriptions
- ❌ Platform limitations

**WearX Counter:** True AI personalization, reliable cloud, weather-aware, fair pricing.
