**Title:** I built an AI stylist that analyzes your wardrobe and tells you what to wear

**Post:**

Hey r/SideProject! 👋

I've been working on something that's been a personal pain point for years: staring at my closet every morning thinking "I have nothing to wear" despite owning 50+ pieces.

**Meet WearX** — an AI-powered wardrobe assistant I built to solve exactly that.

**What it does:**
- 📸 Snap photos of your clothes → AI automatically catalogs them (brand, color, category, season)
- 🤖 Get daily outfit suggestions based on weather, your calendar, and personal style
- 🔄 Discover new combinations from pieces you already own (my favorite feature — found 12 new outfits I never considered)
- 📊 Track what you actually wear vs. what sits untouched

**Tech stack if you're curious:**
- Next.js + TypeScript frontend
- Python/FastAPI backend
- OpenAI Vision for clothing recognition
- PostgreSQL for wardrobe data
- Deployed on Vercel

**The journey:**
Started as a weekend project 6 months ago after yet another "nothing to wear" morning. Turned into a full-blown obsession. The AI recognition was surprisingly tricky — teaching it to distinguish between "navy blazer" and "black blazer" in different lighting took way longer than expected.

**Current status:**
- ✅ Core AI working well
- ✅ Mobile app functional
- 🔄 Onboarding flow needs polish
- 🔄 Need real user feedback on recommendations

**Looking for beta testers:**
If you struggle with wardrobe decisions or just want to try something new, I'd love your feedback. Not looking for hype — want honest opinions on what's broken and what sucks.

Happy to answer technical questions or share lessons learned from building this. What would you want to see in a wardrobe AI?
