**Title:** I made an app that digitizes your closet and suggests outfits — looking for beta testers

**Post:**

Hi FFA! 💕

This community has been invaluable for understanding personal style, capsule wardrobes, and dressing for my body type. After years of learning here, I built something I hope can help others:

**WearX** — your AI-powered wardrobe companion.

**What it does:**
- 📷 Digitize your closet (snap photos of your pieces)
- 🎯 Get personalized outfit suggestions based on your actual clothes
- 🌤️ Weather-appropriate recommendations (no more freezing in skirts)
- 📅 Occasion-based styling (work, brunch, travel, date night)
- 🧩 Discover new combinations from pieces you already own

**Features inspired by FFA discussions:**
- Body type considerations in outfit suggestions
- Color palette guidance
- Capsule wardrobe optimization
- Seasonal transition planning
- "Cost per wear" tracking (helpful for investment pieces)

**My story:**
I was the person with a full closet and "nothing to wear." After tracking what I actually wore for 3 months, I realized I used 20% of my clothes 80% of the time. This app helps me rotate pieces and get more value from what I own.

**Looking for 10 beta testers:**

**You'll receive:**
- ✨ Early access + free lifetime premium
- 🎤 Direct influence on features
- 🌟 Founding member recognition
- 💬 Private beta community access

**What I need:**
- 30-60 minutes per week testing
- Honest feedback (especially on recommendation quality)
- iOS or Android

**Apply:** https://wearx.app

Looking for diverse styles and body types — minimalist, maximalist, professional, casual, everything in between. Your input will directly shape the product.

Questions welcome! 💬
