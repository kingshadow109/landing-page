**Title:** Launching my AI fashion startup — would love feedback from fellow entrepreneurs

**Post:**

Hey r/Entrepreneur!

After 6 months of nights and weekends, I'm finally ready to share what I've been building:

**WearX** — an AI-powered wardrobe management app.

**The opportunity I see:**
The average person wears 20% of their clothes 80% of the time. Fast fashion keeps growing, yet we have overflowing closets and "nothing to wear." I believe AI can help people maximize existing wardrobes instead of buying more.

**What it does:**
- AI catalogs your clothes from photos
- Personalized outfit recommendations (weather, occasion, style)
- Discovers new combinations from existing pieces
- Tracks style evolution and wardrobe utilization

**Current traction:**
- MVP complete, core AI working
- 50+ alpha users, strong retention
- Organic interest from fashion communities
- Preparing for public beta

**Business model:**
Freemium — free basic wardrobe management, premium for unlimited items + advanced AI features + style analytics. Targeting $9.99/month or $79/year premium.

**What I'm looking for:**

1. **Beta testers** — 10 people to stress-test the product before wider launch
2. **Feedback** — on positioning, pricing, anything I'm missing
3. **Advice** — from anyone who's launched consumer apps, especially in fashion/AI

**Challenges I'm facing:**
- User acquisition costs in fashion/consumer space
- Balancing AI accuracy vs. processing costs
- Onboarding friction (wardrobe digitization takes time)

**Sign up for beta:** https://wearx.app

Would genuinely appreciate any thoughts, criticism, or advice. This is my first consumer app after years in B2B SaaS, so I'm learning as I go.

What's your take on the fashion tech space? Am I solving a real problem or a nice-to-have?
