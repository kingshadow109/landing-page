**Title:** [Tool] Built an AI that gives outfit recommendations based on clothes you already own

**Post:**

Hey MFA!

Long-time lurker here. This sub taught me about fit, building a versatile wardrobe, and the importance of quality basics. Now I'm hoping to give back with something I built:

**WearX** — an AI wardrobe tool designed with MFA principles in mind.

**The problem it solves:**
I had a decent wardrobe (uniqlo basics, a few quality pieces, proper fit) but kept falling into the same 3-4 outfit combinations. Meanwhile, great pieces sat unworn because I couldn't visualize how to wear them.

**What it does:**
- Upload your clothes → AI catalogs everything
- Get outfit suggestions based on occasion (work, weekend, date, etc.)
- Weather-aware recommendations (no more underdressing for rain)
- "Versatility score" — see which pieces give you the most outfit options
- Color coordination suggestions

**Built with MFA in mind:**
- Prioritizes fit and proportion in recommendations
- Suggests occasion-appropriate combinations
- Helps maximize your existing wardrobe before buying new
- No "fashion advice" — just helps you use what you have better

**Not trying to replace MFA** — think of it as a tool to implement the advice you already get here. The AI doesn't tell you "buy this" — it shows you new ways to wear what you own.

**Looking for beta testers:**
Want 10 guys with different styles (business casual, streetwear, minimalist, etc.) to test this and tell me what's broken.

**You get:**
- Free lifetime access
- Direct line to suggest features
- Help shape a tool for the MFA community

Would love to hear your thoughts — especially on what features would actually be useful vs. gimmicky.
