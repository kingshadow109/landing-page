## 💬 ENGAGEMENT TACTICS

### How to Respond to Comments

#### Reddit Comments

| Comment Type | Response Strategy | Example |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Positive** | Thank + Add value + Soft CTA | "Thanks! We spent a lot of time on the UX. If you try it, would love your feedback on the dashboard!" |
| **Question** | Answer thoroughly + Follow-up | Detailed answer + "Happy to dive deeper if you want to DM me" |
| **Criticism** | Acknowledge + Explain + Invite | "Fair point. We actually considered that and chose X because Y. Would you approach it differently?" |
| **Negative/Troll** | Don't engage or kill with kindness | "Sorry you feel that way. If you have specific feedback, we're all ears." |
| **Feature Request** | Acknowledge + Roadmap hint | "Great idea! It's actually on our Q2 roadmap. Want early access when it's ready?" |

**Reddit Engagement Rules:**
- Reply within 1 hour during active hours
- Be human, not corporate
- Admit mistakes openly
- Never argue - discuss instead
- Use formatting (bold, lists) for readability
- Edit main post with updates/FAQs

#### Twitter Comments

| Comment Type | Response Strategy | Example |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Positive** | Emoji + Thanks + Question | "🙏 Thanks! What feature are you most excited to try?" |
| **Question** | Quick answer + Visual if needed | Short reply + screenshot/link |
| **Complaint** | Apologize + Fix + Follow up | "Sorry about that! DM us your email and we'll sort it out." |
| **Mention/Share** | Quote tweet with thanks | Amplify their share with added context |

**Twitter Engagement Rules:**
- Reply within 30 minutes during peak hours
- Use threads for complex answers
- Quote tweet positive mentions
- Like most replies (acknowledgment)
- Retweet with comment to amplify

### When to Repost

#### Reddit Reposting Strategy

| Scenario | Action | Timeline |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Post removed by mods | Message mods, understand rules, repost with changes | After mod approval |
| Post flops (< 10 upvotes) | Delete and repost at better time/different subreddit | 24+ hours later |
| Post does well | Cross-post to related subreddits with adapted title | 2-3 days later |
| Major update | New post with "[Update]" tag | 1 week+ later |

**Never:**
- Post same content to multiple subreddits simultaneously
- Delete and immediately repost (looks spammy)
- Use the exact same title

#### Twitter Reposting Strategy

| Scenario | Action | Timeline |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Tweet underperforms | Quote tweet with new angle/context | Same day or next day |
| Major announcement | Pin tweet, then unpin and retweet with update | As needed |
| Evergreen content | Schedule repost every 2-3 weeks | Ongoing |
| Thread | Turn best tweets into standalone posts | 1 week later |

### Cross-Promotion Strategy

#### Reddit → Twitter
1. Screenshot best Reddit comments/discussions
2. Tweet: "The r/SideProject community asked some great questions about WearX... [screenshot]"
3. Link back to Reddit thread for "full discussion"
4. Tag relevant users if they're on Twitter

#### Twitter → Reddit
1. Turn popular tweet threads into Reddit posts
2. Add more detail for Reddit's longer-form format
3. Reference Twitter discussion: "Posted this on Twitter and got great questions, thought I'd share here with more detail"
4. Cross-link at the end of Reddit post

#### Unified Approach
| Content Type | Primary Platform | Secondary Platform | Timing Gap |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Launch announcement | Twitter (thread) | Reddit (r/SideProject, r/startup) | Same day, 1-2 hours apart |
| Technical deep dive | Reddit (r/webdev) | Twitter (summary thread) | Reddit first, Twitter next day |
| User testimonials | Twitter (quick share) | Reddit (detailed case study) | Twitter first, Reddit later |
| Major updates | Both simultaneously | - | Adapt format for each |
