Behind the scenes: Training WearX's AI to understand fashion took 3 months of iterating on prompts and building the right dataset.

The secret? Real user wardrobes, not stock photos.

Every suggestion gets better as more people use it.

### DAY 3 - WEDNESDAY

**11:00 AM IST - Reddit r/malefashionadvice**
```
Title: Tool: I made an app that suggests outfits from clothes you already own

Body:
Hey MFA!

Long-time lurker, first-time poster. I built something I think this community might appreciate.

WearX helps you:
• Upload your wardrobe (photos)
• Get AI-powered outfit suggestions
• See cost-per-wear for each piece
• Build a more intentional closet

Why: I was buying new clothes every season but wearing the same 5 outfits. This helped me realize I had 30+ combinations I never tried.

For the data nerds: Tracks wears, cost-per-wear, style categories

Looking for guys who want to test it and help me improve it.

Would love feedback from this community specifically!

A) Nothing to wear despite full closet
B) Buying clothes I never wear
C) Don't know what goes with what

### DAY 4 - THURSDAY

**10:30 AM IST - Reddit r/femalefashionadvice**
```
Title: I made an app that digitizes your closet and suggests outfits

Body:
Hi FFA!

I've been working on WearX, an AI fashion assistant that:

✨ Uploads your wardrobe (just take photos)
✨ Suggests outfits based on what you own
✨ Tracks cost-per-wear
✨ Considers weather
✨ Learns your style preferences

I built this because I was overwhelmed by my closet but always felt like I had nothing to wear. Turns out I was wearing 20% of my clothes 80% of the time.

The AI suggests combinations I'd never think of - like pairing that skirt I forgot about with my go-to top.

Looking for beta testers who want to try it!

Would especially love feedback on the outfit suggestions!

The best part of building WearX?
